There are too many repositories.
We love programming; however, to manage many repositories is quite hard and bothersome tasks.
Therefore, we built a headquarter for managing the git repositories, named `rrh`.
`rrh` manages repositories by categorizing in groups and execute git command to the groups.

I know the tool [`ghq`](https://github.com/motemen/ghq), manages the git repositories.
However, I cannot use it for the following reasons.

1. there are quite many repositories in my home directory.
    * To start using `ghq`, we clone the repositories.
      However, I did not accept to clone all of the repositories.
2. The location of repositories is fixed in the config file and is accepted only one location.
    * I decide the directory layout in my home directory.

Additionally, I edit several repositories in a day, when I work hard.
Consequently, the progress of each repository is obscured; I cannot remember a lot of things.
Therefore, it is glad to see the last modified date of branches.

`rrh` is now growing. Please hack `rrh` itself.
