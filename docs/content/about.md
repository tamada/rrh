### Why the project name RRH

At first, the name of this project was GRIM (Git Repository Integrated Manager).
However, the means of `grim` is not good, and there are many commands which start with `gr`.
Therefore, we changed the project name to `rrh`.
RRH means "Repositories, Ready to Hack" or "Remote Repositories Head," are not the abbreviation of the Red Riding Hood.
