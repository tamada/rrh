### Why the project name RRH

At first, the name of this project was GRIM (Git Repository Integrated Manager).
However, the means of `grim` is not good, and there are many commands which start with `gr`.
Therefore, we changed the project name to RRH.
RRH means "Repositories, Ready to Hack," or "Remote Repositories Head," is not the abbreviation of "Red Riding Hood." :smile:
